I wanted to learn how to make my own chatbot, one that I could personalise to what I needed and wanted. 
This repo will follow along until I have a functioning chatbot. As I go along, all files I make, I may come up and design a bot around them to continue practicing my skills. All my notes for each day are in a notion doc, that I will add to the repo at the end of the 30 days.


Day 1
I covered try and accept, as well as reading and writing to CSV files. I built a simple expense tracker with the skills that I had learnt. It basically just adds expenses to a csv file, and then allows you to view all the expenses. The basics for now.

Day 2 
I spent day to reading over JSON Files, and understanding how to interact with them within python. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It will be important for doing front end work. It also has and ascii or ignore ascii value options.
