I wanted to learn how to make my own chatbot, one that I could personalise to what I needed and wanted. 
This repo will follow along until I have a functioning chatbot. As I go along, all files I make, I may come up and design a bot around them to continue practicing my skills.


Day 1
I covered try and accept, as well as reading and writing to CSV files. I built a simple expense tracker with the skills that I had learnt. It basically just adds expenses to a csv file, and then allows you to view all the expenses. The basics for now.
